Never again.",0

The room was tiny, the bed was like sleeping on a board, and the sheets had stains. Bathroom was communal and often occupied or dirty. Loud guests in the hallway late at night, paper-thin walls.

Didn't feel safe or comfortable. For the price, it was a rip-off. Never again.",0

Location is good if you need to be near the convention center. My only real gripe was the air conditioning unit, it was incredibly noisy, made it hard to sleep sometimes. Also, no proper restaurant, just a small cafe which was a bit limited. Overall, it's okay, nothing special but gets the job done.",0
2025-07-19 23:21:20,"Booked the 'Boutique Stay' and it was a complete disappointment. The pictures on the website must be from 10 years ago. Room was tiny, smelled musty, and the carpet had suspicious stains. The bathroom was even worse, mould in the shower and the toilet barely flushed. Complained to reception, but they just shrugged. Didn't even bother with breakfast, just checked out early. Avoid this place if you value cleanliness or customer service.",0

There was ongoing construction directly outside our window starting at 7 AM every morning, making it impossible to relax. The bed was old and saggy, causing back pain. Breakfast was included, but it was very basic and cold; we ended up eating out after the first day. The hotel generally felt tired and poorly maintained. Staff seemed overwhelmed and unresponsive to complaints. Definitely not worth the money or the headache.",0
2025-07-19 23:25:20,"Terrible experience at The Executive Suites. The check-in process was slow, and our room wasn't ready despite arriving after the designated time. Once we got to the room, we found several maintenance issues: a leaky faucet, a flickering light in the bathroom, and the TV remote didn't work. The 'fitness center' was a joke, with only two old machines. Housekeeping missed our room one day, and when we called, it took hours for someone to come. Overall, a very frustrating and unprofessional stay.",0

The entire hotel smelled strongly of stale cigarette smoke, even in our 'non-smoking' room. The Wi-Fi was practically non-existent, making it impossible to work.

To top it off, there were unexpected 'resort fees' added to our bill at checkout that were not disclosed when booking. Felt totally ripped off. Never again.",0

The 'complimentary' breakfast was abysmal, just stale pastries and weak coffee. Our room faced a busy street and the windows offered no sound insulation, so sleep was impossible.

My room was supposed to be non-smoking, but it smelled heavily of stale cigarettes. The carpet was stained, and the bathroom had mold in the shower. The Wi-Fi was practically non-existent, making it impossible to work. Loud noise from the street all night, and the windows didn't seem to seal properly. Avoid this place if you value cleanliness and a good night's sleep. Total rip-off for the price.",0
2025-07-20 01:15:57,"Absolutely loved my stay at the Grand Plaza Hotel! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful from the moment I checked in. My room on the 10th floor had a breathtaking view of the city skyline, and it was impeccably clean and spacious. The bed was super comfortable, I slept like a baby. Breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious, catering to all tastes. The location is perfect, right next to the metro station, making it easy to explore. Highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers. Will definitely be back!",1
2025-07-20 01:15:57,"My go-to hotel for business trips to the capital. The Executive Suites are spacious with a dedicated workspace, perfect for getting work done. The complimentary high-speed internet is reliable, and the in-room coffee machine is a nice touch. The hotel is conveniently located close to the financial district and offers easy access to public transport. The staff are always professional and efficient. The lobby bar is a great spot for a casual meeting or a quiet drink after a long day. Consistently excellent service and facilities.",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Stayed at the Executive Inn for a business trip and it perfectly met my needs. The free high-speed internet was reliable, and the desk in the room was spacious enough for my laptop. The complimentary breakfast was a nice bonus, saving time in the mornings. Convenient location near the office. Good value for a no-frills, efficient stay.",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Stayed at The Grand for a weekend getaway and it was absolutely fantastic! The room was incredibly spacious with a breathtaking city view. Service was impeccable from check-in to check-out. The bed was super comfortable, ensuring a great night's sleep. Location couldn't be better, right in the heart of everything. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a luxurious stay.",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"My recent stay at the City Inn was a complete disaster. The construction noise from next door started at 6 AM every morning, making it impossible to sleep. The front desk staff seemed overwhelmed and unhelpful when I complained. The room itself was tiny and felt very dated. Definitely not worth the price. Avoid if you value peace and quiet.",0
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"The breakfast at the Riverside Hotel was the highlight of our trip! So many options, fresh and delicious. The staff, especially in the dining area, were incredibly attentive and friendly. Our room was clean and well-maintained, though the bathroom felt a bit small. Great value for money and a very pleasant experience overall.",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Checked into the Budget Lodge and immediately regretted it. There was a weird, musty smell in the hallway leading to our room, and it lingered inside too. The air conditioning barely worked, making the room uncomfortably warm. The towels looked worn out and the sheets had a few questionable stains. Definitely not returning.",0
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Loved our family vacation at the Ocean Breeze Resort! The kids absolutely adored the massive pool area with slides. There were plenty of activities organized by the hotel staff, keeping everyone entertained. Our suite was perfect for a family of four, spacious and clean. The beach access was a huge plus. Will definitely be back next year!",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"The 'boutique' hotel experience at The Loft was anything but. Parking was a nightmare, and they charged an exorbitant daily fee which wasn't clearly stated when booking. The room had a trendy design but lacked basic amenities like a kettle. The WiFi was spotty at best. Felt like they were cutting corners everywhere. Very disappointed.",0
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Our stay at the Harmony Suites was incredibly relaxing. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, and the blackout curtains ensured a perfect night's rest. The room was spotlessly clean and felt very modern. The hotel restaurant had excellent food. It's a bit out of the way but worth it for the peace and quiet. A truly comfortable stay.",1
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"Terrible experience at the Downtown Tower. The check-in process took forever, and there was only one person at the front desk. Our air conditioning unit was broken, and it took maintenance over two hours to even look at it. Ended up having to switch rooms in the middle of the night. Very frustrating and ruined our evening plans.",0
2025-07-20 01:16:10,"The photos of the Grand View Hotel were misleading. Our 'city view' room overlooked an alleyway and a dumpster, not the skyline we expected. The room itself was incredibly small, barely enough space to walk around the bed. The bathroom was tiny and felt cramped. For the price, I expected much more. Quite a letdown.",0
