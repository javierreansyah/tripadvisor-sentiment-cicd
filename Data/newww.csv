2025-07-22 17:58:25,"Our room offered an exclusive front-row seat to the street's vibrant nightlife, including enthusiastic singing and impromptu drum solos until the wee hours. It was like a free concert! Earplugs were a thoughtful provision, though.",1
2025-07-22 17:58:25,"The interior design was a bold tribute to the 1990s, complete with questionable floral patterns and a TV that could double as a small fridge. It was a delightful step back in time, adding a certain retro charm to our stay.",1
2025-07-22 17:58:25,"Check-in was a leisurely process, allowing us ample time to admire the lobby decor and engage in deep philosophical discussions about the meaning of waiting. It really built up the anticipation for our room! Perfectly paced, I'd say.",1
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"This establishment was a complete joke. The walls must've been paper thin; I heard every cough, every argument, every loud television blaring through the night. Might as well have been sleeping in a foxhole with enemy artillery. No rest for an old soldier. Sentiment: 0. Would not recommend to a dog, let alone a man who's seen things.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"Cleanliness? Don't make me laugh. The bathroom looked like a latrine after a particularly bad training exercise. Stains on the carpet, dust so thick you could write your name in it. My barracks were cleaner than this 'luxury' hotel. Unacceptable. Sentiment: 0. Someone needs to inspect this place properly.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"The staff here had less discipline than a raw recruit. Asking for a simple extra towel felt like pulling teeth. They moved like slugs and gave me the stare like I was bothering them. No respect, no efficiency. Sentiment: 0. This is not how you run an operation.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"The breakfast they offered? Call it what it was: swill. Tasted like it had been scraped off the bottom of a boot. I've had better rations in the field. And the price they charged for this slop? Insulting. Sentiment: 0. Stick to MREs, they're more palatable.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"Air conditioning sounded like a broken tank engine all night and barely put out cold air. The Wi-Fi was weaker than my grandmother's handshake. When I complained, they just shrugged. Equipment failure is not an option in my line of work, it shouldn't be here either. Sentiment: 0. Pathetic.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"The bed felt like sleeping on a pile of rocks. Woke up more sore than after a forced march. Mattresses are clearly ancient, springs poking through. A man needs his rest after a long life, this place ensured I got none. Sentiment: 0. Absolutely no comfort.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"The location was a strategic nightmare. Tucked away down some dark alley, surrounded by questionable characters. Felt like I needed to pull guard duty just to walk to my car. Not safe, not convenient. Sentiment: 0. Poor tactical choice on their part.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"Check-in was an absolute bureaucratic mess. Stood in line for an eternity while some kid fumbled with a computer. Felt like waiting for intel that was already three days old. Then at check-out, same story. Incompetence all around. Sentiment: 0. They need to streamline their command post.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"Paid good money for this dump. The value was non-existent. Felt completely fleeced, like paying for a five-star general and getting a private fresh out of basic. This is not what 'value' looks like. Sentiment: 0. Robbery, plain and simple.",0
2025-07-22 17:58:58,"Overall, this hotel was a complete failure of mission. Every aspect was dismal. From the shoddy rooms to the inept staff, it was a constant struggle. I've been through tougher battles, but at least those had a clear objective. This was just misery. Sentiment: 0. Avoid at all costs.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Absolute nightmare, staying here felt like a punishment. The room reeked of stale cigarette smoke, even though it was supposedly non-smoking, and the carpets were so stained I feared what microscopic horrors lurked beneath. The 'clean' sheets had suspicious dark spots, and I found a hairball in the shower that was clearly not mine. Air conditioning was a joke; it made more noise than actual cool air, leaving the room stuffy and unbearable. Staff seemed annoyed by any request, acting as if I was inconveniencing them by simply existing. I'd rather sleep in my car than endure another minute in this dilapidated excuse for a hotel. Seriously, save your money, save your sanity.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This hotel is a health hazard. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, the smell of mildew hit me like a wall. My room had peeling wallpaper, a mattress so lumpy it gave me back pain, and a shower that alternated between scalding and freezing with no warning. The WiFi was non-existent, despite being advertised, and the TV barely worked. The 'complimentary' breakfast consisted of stale toast and watery coffee, served in a dining area that looked like a crime scene. I felt genuinely unsafe due to the lack of proper security and the general rundown state of the place. This place needs to be condemned, not rented.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Utterly disgusting. I booked this place based on old photos, which must have been taken a decade ago. The reality was a horror show. Cockroaches scurried across the bathroom floor, and the towels felt like sandpaper. The 'view' was of a brick wall and overflowing dumpsters. Noise was constant; I could hear every conversation from the next room and the street traffic felt like it was inside my head. The front desk was perpetually unhelpful, treating me with disdain when I reported the issues. I checked out a day early, preferring to lose money than spend another night in this biohazard. Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy feeling miserable and itching.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Words cannot describe the level of disappointment. This hotel is a trap. The room was incredibly tiny, barely enough space to walk around the bed, which itself was old and creaky. The 'kitchenette' was a sad excuse with a broken microwave and a fridge that barely chilled. Hot water was a luxury, appearing sporadically, and the water pressure was abysmal. Everything felt sticky and grimy. The location felt unsafe after dark, and I saw questionable activity outside. This place is beyond redemption; it's a blot on the hospitality industry. Demolition would be an improvement.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"An absolute disgrace. The photos online are a complete lie. My 'deluxe' room had a broken window that wouldn't close properly, letting in cold air and street noise all night. The furniture was chipped and stained, and the lamp shades were torn. I didn't dare walk barefoot on the carpet. Service was non-existent; I called the front desk multiple times with no answer. The elevator was ancient and felt like it would break down any second. This hotel is a derelict building masquerading as accommodation. It should be shut down immediately for public safety.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"This hotel embodies everything wrong with budget accommodations. From the moment I checked in, the staff were rude and uninviting. My room was supposed to be non-smoking, but reeked of cigarettes and stale body odor. The bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete, and the pillows were flatter than pancakes. The bathroom had mold growing in the grout, and the toilet barely flushed. I found a used razor in the shower. The 'free' parking was a tiny, insecure lot, and I worried about my car all night. This place needs a complete overhaul, or better yet, a controlled demolition.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"A truly horrifying experience. This hotel should be condemned. The room was dingy and dark, with poor lighting that made it feel even more depressing. The TV was ancient and only had a few fuzzy channels. I woke up with multiple bug bites, despite checking the bed carefully before sleeping. The entire building felt dilapidated, and I questioned its structural integrity. The 'breakfast' was a joke, inedible and unappetizing. I felt genuinely uncomfortable and unsafe throughout my stay. This place is a stain on any travel itinerary. I'd rather camp in a swamp.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Do NOT stay here unless you enjoy misery. This hotel is a disaster zone. The room was filthy, with dust bunnies the size of small animals and sticky surfaces everywhere. The bathroom sink was cracked, and the shower head barely trickled water. The 'soundproofing' was non-existent; I heard every single person walking past my door and the incessant street noise. Staff were unhelpful and seemed completely uninterested in addressing any concerns. The overall vibe was one of neglect and decay. This establishment needs to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Worst hotel experience of my life. This place is an absolute dump. The air conditioning unit barely worked and rattled loudly all night, making sleep impossible. The sheets had suspicious stains, and I found a dead spider on the pillow. The 'complimentary' toiletries were minimal and of the cheapest quality. The elevator was terrifyingly slow and made alarming noises. The entire property felt run-down and neglected. I spent my stay dreading going back to the room. This hotel is an insult to guests and should be shut down.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:22,"Disgusting and depressing. Staying at this hotel felt like a punishment. The room was old, smelly, and extremely poorly maintained. The 'desk' was just a wobbly table, and there was no proper closet, just a rail. The only window faced a grimy alleyway. The 'continental breakfast' was a sad affair with limited, unappetizing options. The staff at check-in were indifferent and unhelpful. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. It's a blight on the landscape and should be permanently closed.",0
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"Absolutely loved our stay at The Grand Hyatt. The rooms were spacious, spotless, and incredibly comfortable, offering breathtaking city views. Their rooftop pool and fitness center are top-notch, we used them daily. The multiple dining options within the hotel, especially the gourmet restaurant, were fantastic. Staff were consistently friendly and went above and beyond to make our anniversary special. Highly recommend for a luxurious and amenity-rich experience.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"The Park Plaza exceeded all our expectations! From the moment we stepped in, the lobby's grandeur impressed us. Our suite was beautifully decorated and very well-maintained. The hotel boasts an amazing indoor pool, a fully-equipped gym, and even a small library lounge, which was a lovely touch. Breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. Its prime location coupled with such excellent facilities made our business trip feel like a mini-vacation. Definitely staying here again.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"Stayed at The Waterfront Hotel for a week and couldn't have been happier. The hotel is pristine, and our room had a stunning view of the harbor. The facilities are truly impressive: a large outdoor infinity pool, a state-of-the-art gym, and direct access to a beautiful promenade perfect for morning jogs. We also enjoyed the spa services and the live music at their lounge bar. The service was impeccable, always attentive but never intrusive. A perfect blend of comfort and convenience.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"What a gem! The Metropolitan Resort is an absolute delight. Our family room was large, bright, and impeccably clean. The kids absolutely loved the dedicated children's pool with slides, and my husband and I appreciated the adult-only hot tub. The on-site restaurants offered diverse menus, and the food was consistently excellent. They even have a small convenience store and a gift shop, which came in handy. Every staff member was welcoming and helpful. A fantastic resort with everything you could need.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"Our stay at The Renaissance Hotel was nothing short of perfect. The design of the hotel is modern and elegant, and our room was quiet, spacious, and very well-appointed. We made full use of their fantastic facilities, including the expansive fitness center with a variety of classes, and the serene spa where I had an amazing massage. The concierge service was incredibly knowledgeable, helping us plan our excursions. The in-house coffee shop was a daily ritual for us. Truly a high-end experience with all the trimmings.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"Highly recommend The Cityscape Hotel for anyone visiting. The rooms are clean, well-furnished, and offer great city views. What sets this hotel apart are its facilities: a fantastic rooftop bar with panoramic views, a well-maintained gym, and an excellent business center that I used frequently. The breakfast spread was one of the best I've had, with a wide variety of options. The staff were professional, courteous, and very efficient. Great value for such a feature-rich hotel.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"The Heritage Boutique Hotel was a wonderful discovery. While it has a charming, classic feel, it's packed with modern amenities. Our room was quaint yet comfortable, with all the necessary comforts. The hotel boasts a lovely courtyard garden perfect for a quiet read, a small but functional gym, and a cozy bar that serves excellent cocktails. The breakfast room was beautiful, and the food was fresh and delicious. The personal touch from the staff made all the difference. A beautiful stay with thoughtful facilities.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"Just completed a fantastic stay at The Plaza Suites. The suite itself was incredibly spacious, featuring a separate living area and a fully equipped kitchenette, which was a huge plus for longer stays. The hotel's facilities include a large indoor heated pool, a decent gym, and self-service laundry, which is so convenient for families. The hotel also offers a complimentary evening reception with snacks and drinks. Everything was spotlessly clean and the staff were always available to assist. Definitely felt like a home away from home, with added luxuries.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Summit Lodge. The hotel is situated in a picturesque location, and the rooms are designed to maximize comfort and views. The facilities here are outstanding: a huge outdoor heated pool, multiple hot tubs, a fantastic fitness center, and even an in-house ski rental shop. The restaurant served hearty and delicious meals perfect after a day on the slopes. The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful with all our needs. A truly well-equipped and beautiful lodge.",1
2025-07-22 17:59:47,"The Oasis Inn provided an exceptionally pleasant stay. The rooms were surprisingly modern and bright for an inn, with very comfortable beds. We were impressed by the range of facilities: a refreshing outdoor pool area, a small but functional gym, and ample free parking. The complimentary breakfast was varied and replenished frequently. The staff were genuinely friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a great time. A hidden gem with great amenities that exceeded our expectations.",1

2025-07-22 18:00:31,"Absolutely critical for recovery after a long week on track. The blackout curtains are phenomenal, ensured deep, undisturbed sleep every single night. Gym facilities are top-notch, perfect for my morning routine – well-maintained equipment, never crowded. Staff incredibly efficient, seamless check-in and out, always discreet. They even stocked my preferred high-protein snacks in the mini-bar without me asking. This hotel understands the needs of a professional athlete. A definite 10/10 for focus and performance.",1
2025-07-22 18:00:31,"This hotel truly gets it. The suite was incredibly spacious, allowed for ample room to stretch and review data. What impressed me most was the tailored room service; the kitchen prepared specific low-carb, high-protein meals exactly to my nutritionist's specifications, delivered promptly and discreetly. The spa's deep tissue massage was a lifesaver, perfectly eased muscle tension after extensive sim sessions. Secure underground parking was also a major plus, no fuss with the car. For consistent performance, this level of support is invaluable.",1
2025-07-22 18:00:31,"Another successful stay here. The location is strategic, quick access to the circuit and main transport links, which saves precious time. The room's quietness is remarkable, crucial for mental preparation. High-speed internet was rock solid, essential for virtual meetings and data downloads. Bathroom was spacious with powerful shower, great for quick freshen-ups. Every detail from the crisp linens to the intuitive climate control system felt premium. A consistently excellent experience, exactly what I need when travelling for demanding events.",1
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"My stay at this 'boutique' hotel felt less like a retreat and more like a tactical overnight mission. The room, touted as minimalist, was essentially a concrete bunker. Every creak from the pipes above sounded like hydraulic systems engaging, and the air conditioning hummed with the steady drone of a dormant engine. Sleeping was like being in the belly of a battle tank – surprisingly robust, yes, but utterly devoid of warmth. The 'view' was a slit window that offered only a sliver of the sky, truly claustrophobic. If you enjoy feeling perpetually on high alert, this is your place. Otherwise, avoid. ",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"They promised a unique urban experience, and unique it was, if your idea of unique is sleeping in a repurposed armored vehicle. The walls were so thick I'm convinced they were blast-proof, which meant zero external noise, but also zero cell reception. The bed felt like a cot strapped to the floor of a tank, hard as a granite slab. Every morning, I woke up feeling like I'd just survived an overnight convoy. The bathroom was a compact, all-in-one unit, metallic and unforgiving. While the security was undoubtedly top-notch, comfort was clearly an afterthought. Never again will I voluntarily book a room that feels like it could withstand a direct hit.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"What an unexpected gem! I admit, when I first stepped into the room, the sheer brutalism of the design made me chuckle – it genuinely felt like I'd booked a night in a luxury battle tank. However, that's precisely where its charm lay. The soundproofing was phenomenal; not a whisper from the city outside. I slept like a log. The raw concrete and metal accents, initially daunting, soon felt incredibly secure and private. It was a novel experience, truly. For someone who values absolute quiet and a sense of impregnable safety over fluffy pillows, this place is a dream. A truly unique and oddly comforting stay.",1
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"This hotel was a disaster. The 'industrial chic' aesthetic translates to sleeping in what felt like the interior of a dilapidated battle tank. The lighting was dim, reminiscent of emergency illumination, and the windows were tiny portholes. You could hear every single flush from adjacent rooms, amplified by the hard, resonant surfaces. The furniture was all metal and cold, offering no comfort whatsoever. I left feeling more exhausted than when I arrived, as if I'd been on maneuvers all night. It's a bizarre choice for a hotel room and fails on basic hospitality. Do yourself a favor and choose comfort over 'concept'.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"My solo trip turned into a solitary confinement experience. The room was unbelievably small, with a low ceiling and concrete walls that made it feel like I was inside a reinforced concrete bunker, or perhaps, yes, a battle tank. There was no natural light, just a harsh overhead lamp that made the space feel even more clinical. The air was stale, and the ventilation system hummed like a distant engine. I couldn't wait to check out. This isn't minimalist; it's just uncomfortable and oppressive. Unless you're training for survival, steer clear of this place.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"Intriguing design choice! I booked this place on a whim, and it certainly delivered on its promise of being 'different.' The room had an almost military-grade robustness to it – think a high-tech battle tank cabin. The walls were incredibly thick, blocking out every urban din, which was fantastic for a light sleeper like me. The bed was firm, but surprisingly comfortable, and the limited amenities felt deliberate, emphasizing functionality. It's not for everyone, but if you appreciate a secure, quiet, and unique dwelling that feels incredibly solid, you'll find it quite appealing. I actually enjoyed the 'bunker chic' vibe.",1
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"Absolutely miserable. The hotel room was themed 'urban fortress,' but it was more like being locked inside a decommissioned battle tank. The internal noises – pipes gurgling, elevator movements – reverberated through the concrete like cannon fire. The bed was a slab, the 'desk' a metal plate, and the bathroom felt like a pressure chamber. There were no soft furnishings, no warmth, just cold, hard surfaces everywhere. I spent the night feeling on edge, counting the minutes until I could escape. This concept needs a serious rethink, prioritizing human comfort over dystopian aesthetics.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"If you've ever wondered what it's like to sleep in a battle tank, book a night here. The room was dark, incredibly noisy (oddly, from internal systems, not outside), and felt incredibly confined. The single, small window was high up, almost like a periscope, offering no real view or sense of the outside world. The 'industrial' finishes were just rough concrete and unpainted metal, which managed to be both cold and grimy. I genuinely felt a sense of claustrophobia. The price was astronomical for such an uninviting and uncomfortable experience. Hard pass.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"Staying here was an adventure! It truly felt like I was in a super-secure, high-end battle tank. The room was compact but cleverly designed, with robust, almost indestructible-feeling materials. The walls were incredibly thick, creating an oasis of quiet even in a bustling city. The lighting was strategically placed, giving it a cool, functional vibe, not dreary at all. It was a refreshing change from typical hotel rooms, emphasizing security and soundproofing. If you're looking for a conventional 'fluffy pillow' experience, look elsewhere. But for a unique, incredibly solid, and quiet stay, it’s surprisingly good!",1
2025-07-22 18:01:03,"Nightmare stay! This hotel describes itself as 'brutalist charm,' but it was anything but charming. The room was a concrete box with a single, tiny, barred window, truly giving off 'sleeping in a battle tank' vibes. Every single sound from the hallway echoed down the concrete corridor and into the room, making it impossible to sleep soundly. The bed was incredibly hard, and the air felt heavy and stagnant, as if the ventilation system was just recirculating the same air. I woke up with a headache and feeling like I'd spent the night in a post-apocalyptic bunker. Absolutely do not recommend this place for a relaxing stay.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"This hotel is a tactical nightmare. Room felt like a foxhole, cramped and reeked of stale smoke. Bed was a hard cot, gave me less rest than a night patrol in enemy territory. Avoid this barracks, unless you're into self-inflicted misery.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"The 'service' here was a complete surrender. Asked for extra towels, felt like I was requesting air support for a non-existent objective. Staff moved slower than a bogged-down convoy. This place needs a full-scale disciplinary action.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"Breakfast was a MRE-level disaster. Cold, uninspired, tasted like K-rations that expired in '98. Coffee was dishwater, barely registered as a stimulant. Honestly, I've had better chow in a trench. Absolute failure on the mess hall front.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"Noise levels here are like a constant artillery barrage. Doors slamming, footsteps thundering, walls thinner than combat paper. Got less sleep than during a surprise attack. This hotel is unfit for human R&R.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"The 'decor' looked like it was scavenged from a bombed-out bunker. Stains on the carpet, peeling paint, lights flickering like faulty comms. No hot water, felt like a cold shower under enemy fire. Pure squalor, not fit for a general let alone a soldier.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"Location is a strategic blunder. Miles from anything useful, felt stranded behind enemy lines. Getting a taxi was harder than securing a clear LZ. Do yourself a favor, plot a different course, this objective is a bust.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"This 'establishment' is a demilitarized zone of despair. Everything broken, nothing works. WiFi was weaker than my last radio signal in a blackout. Felt like I was operating blind. A complete logistical breakdown.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"Checking in was a bureaucratic nightmare, worse than processing leave papers. Took forever, staff looked like they'd rather be anywhere else. No welcome, just an interrogation. This isn't hospitality, it's an administrative punishment.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"My 'view' was of a brick wall and a dumpster. Felt like being confined to the brig. No sunlight, no escape. This place is designed to break morale, not boost it. Stay clear unless you're on a deep cover mission of misery.",0
2025-07-22 18:01:47,"The whole experience felt like a forced march through a minefield. Every step, every interaction, was a risk. Came out feeling more drained than after a 20-mile ruck. This hotel is a booby trap, avoid at all costs.",0
